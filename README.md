# STATE MACHINE EXAMPLE - JS (VANILLA)

Some examples of state machine implementation using vanilla JS.

## What is a State Machine

State Machine or finite-state machine (FSM) is a mathematical model of computation.

It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time.

The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition.

An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the inputs that trigger each transition.

## Application Examples

We describe some possibilities of State Machine usage bellow.

Application code is located inside the folder with the same name of the example.

### Turnstile

A turnstile is used to control access to an area. 

The turnstile has two possible states: Locked and Unlocked.

Dispatch change the current state to the another defined.
